 [![Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Springerle/py-generic-project/master/docs/_static/img/logo.png)](https://py-generic-project.readthedocs.io/)

A cookiecutter template that creates a basic Python setuptools project,
which can be later on augmented with various optional accessories.
See the [demo](https://github.com/Springerle/py-generic-project/tree/master/demo)
for getting a 1ˢᵗ impression on how this Cookiecutter template can be used,
including screenshots of the terminal session.

## Features

The resulting project uses
[rituals](https://github.com/jhermann/rituals)
and [invoke](https://github.com/pyinvoke/invoke/)
for task automation, and
[setuptools](https://bitbucket.org/pypa/setuptools)
for building and distributing the project.
A provided [autoenv](https://github.com/kennethreitz/autoenv) script takes care
of creating a fully boot-strapped `virtualenv` or `venv` – it can also be called manually
if you don't want to install `autoenv`.

Other integrated tools are `pylint` for code quality checking,
`pytest` for testing support, and a Travis CI configuration.

## Split Licensing

Since the files contained in the ``{{cookiecutter.repo_name}}`` archetype itself
will comprise the foundation of your project, they're unlicensed using the
“Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal” license.
All other files outside the ``{{cookiecutter.repo_name}}`` directory are
MIT-licensed – this effectively means you only have to attribute this project
if you re-use all or parts of the contained templating mechanics and documentation.

* [![Project License](http://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-red.svg)](https://github.com/Springerle/py-generic-project/blob/master/LICENSE_MIT) for the project.
* [![Template License](http://img.shields.io/badge/license-CC0-blue.svg)](https://github.com/Springerle/py-generic-project/blob/master/LICENSE_CC0) for the template proper (everything in `{{cookiecutter.repo_name}}`), unless specified otherwise within the file itself.
